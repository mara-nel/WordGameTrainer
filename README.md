Word Game Trainer is a tool to help you learn the words that will elevate your play in word games like Scrabble. Modeled after the [Cheat Sheet](https://www.cross-tables.com/cs.php) compiled by Mike Baron and John Attamack, here you can learn your two letter words, hooks for two letter words, short J/Q/X/Z words, and power bingo stems (6 common letters for which any additional letter almost guarantees a 7 letter word). This tool also integrates with the [Free Dictionary API](https://dictionaryapi.dev/) so you can learn the meaning of the words you play.
